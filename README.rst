**Py**\ thon **A**\ stronomical **T**\ ools.

A package providing useful tools for astronomical analysis.  It is in continuous developing and  presently provides 
the following procedures

- Estimate the systematic error of a light curve;
- Generate formatted input files for MICA package;
- Calculate mean and rms spectra and their line widths;
- Remove outliers from a light curve using the median filter;
- Rebin spectra by keeping the total flux unchanged;
- Calculate interpolated cross-correlation function (ICCF);
- Reconstruct light curves using damped random walk model;
- Detrend light curves using a linear detrend.
